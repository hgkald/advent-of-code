# Advent of Code 

Advent of Code is an annual advent calendar of programming puzzles. Each day unveils a new problem, and when the first part is solved, the second part of the problem is unlocked. Each part solved gains you stars. 

I mostly do it for fun, and to practice solving different sorts of problems. 

Hosted on [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

Take two! Going with Python again just to get the problems solved, but will see if I can add another language to try out.

I only found out about AoC this year, so I dipped my toes in the water while sitting at home with a newborn (!). It was good to flex the programming muscles, but I didn't get very far.
